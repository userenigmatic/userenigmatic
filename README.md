# Emmanuel Oyebamiji — Data Scientist (AML/Risk)

I build practical AI/analytics for **KYC, sanctions screening, and transaction monitoring**. My focus is high-signal detection with low false-positives, plus clean dashboards stakeholders can trust.

**Focus areas:** Transaction anomaly detection · KYC risk scoring · Sanctions/PEP fuzzy matching · SAR drafting support  
**Tooling:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, rapidfuzz), SQL (T-SQL), Power BI, Streamlit, Git/GitHub

## Works
- **Sanctions & PEP Screening** — Fuzzy matching + Streamlit dashboard (tests included) → repo
- **KYC Risk Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)** — Rules engine + visuals → repo
- **SAR Drafting Prototype** — First-draft narratives + completeness/readability checks → repo
- **Transaction Anomaly Detection** — Isolation Forest vs z-score vs DBSCAN (benchmark & trade-offs) → repo

- Reducing alert noise while keeping investigators focused on real risk
- Transparent rules + explainable ML that auditors can follow
- Clean repos that others can clone and run in minutes
